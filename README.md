# Swore
Swore is a web rendering framework. We are trying to improve :).

## Oh so how can I improve Swore?
1. Submit issues! Even if you don't know how to code. Help us out. (wait, if you didn't know how to code why'd you use swore)
2. Submit pull requests! If you know GitHub, you understand...
3. Help improve this, just submit an issue to become a contributor.

## Any rules?
1. There are none
2. I said there are none!
3. Why is this list so long?
